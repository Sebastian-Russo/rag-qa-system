## Summary

12,921 chunks from 6.2 million characters — that's solid. The chunking looks clean too: the middle sample is clearly mid-narrative from Order of the Phoenix, and it's breaking at reasonable boundaries.
The last chunk is just copyright boilerplate — we could filter that out but it won't hurt anything, the retriever will just never match it.
