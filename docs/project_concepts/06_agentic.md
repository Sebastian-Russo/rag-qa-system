# Agent (Project 6) goes even further.

The model isn't just answering questions — it's deciding what actions to take. It gets a goal, plans steps, uses tools (search, code execution, APIs), observes results, and adjusts. This is where everything converges: the LLM understands language (like sentiment/text gen), retrieves information (like RAG), and takes sequential actions (like time series — step by step, each depending on the last).
